        <h3>Identification Number</h3>
        <p>Gabriel & Co. has established an inventory tracking system for every jewelry piece produced and shipped to
          our retail partners or consumers. Each piece includes a unique laser inscribed serial number that is trackable
          once registered online with proof of purchase. This unique serial number can be tracked through a 26-step
          process e.g. identifying the designer who created the piece, the source of diamonds, gemstones and metals,
          quality control, the shipment information and the customer who purchases and registers the jewelry online.
          Under our warranty, we are able to identify the owner of each piece ensuring security and global ownership in
          the event that an accident or loss occurs. That is what we call peace of mind.
